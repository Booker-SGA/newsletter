      <h2>An Update From Student Government</h2>
      <p>Student government had a busy month, with all four classes coming together to make our Afterglow Homecoming a
        success! The Sophomore class showed off their school spirit with their amazing hallway decorations and energy at
        the pep rally! The class of 2028 is also still working hard on the Booker Basics Initiative by restocking the
        bathrooms with free feminine products weekly, and our own Ava Donoghue was featured on the Suncoast View to
        speak about it! After running the very popular photobooth at Homecoming, the Juniors are hard at work planning
        fundraisers and prom! Finally, after spearheading the Homecoming planning, next on the agenda for the class of
        2026 is Senior Sunrise! This will be on 10/24 at 6:20 AM, and will feature games, crafts, and a Chick-fil-a
        breakfast.
        We are so excited for this upcoming month, and thank you to everyone who made this past month such a success!

      <h2>A Message from Ms. Ladd</h2>
      <p>September was a busy month! Another HOCO season has come and gone. In the middle of all the preparation for
        HOCO, SGA still managed to organize our first Club RUSH. It went well and we are looking forward to our next
        Club RUSH on Oct. 22nd.

        I want to take a moment and shine the spotlight on our SGA officers, members, and advisors who put in long hours
        and have been planning since July. SGA is student led and they plan spirit week, the pep rally, hall
        decorations, the HOCO dance, and fundraising at the homecoming game. Their hard work and dedication have not
        gone unnoticed.

        Thank you to the staff who participated in spirit week and to those of you who sent kind words to the students
        about all they did to make HOCO/spirit week happen.
        Thank you to our SGA parents who contributed to HOCO. Our SGA parents are the best from purchasing items for
        homecoming to helping us set up. We appreciate YOU!
        Shout out to our sophomore president, Ava Donoghue who was on ABC 7 news talking about her Booker Basic
        initiative. If you want to watch it here is <a href="https://www.mysuncoast.com/2025/09/16/booker-basics-initiative-with-voices-florida/">the link.</a></p>
