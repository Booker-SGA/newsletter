        <p>Senior SGA is ready to make this an amazing year full of surprises and opportunities! This year our Senior
          class has chosen a theme, Year of Achievement. We will focus on making sure our seniors are ready for their
          next steps and will celebrate all of our accomplishments. We plan to listen to our fellow classmates and make
          sure every voice at Booker high school is heard. We want to connect our school whether it’s working with our
          Visual Performing Arts Department or helping our football team with concession. Brining our school together is
          our goal, and we cannot wait to start!</p>

      <h2>JUNIOR CLASS</h2>

      <div class="box gold-box">
        <p>The junior class is hard at work planning fundraising activities to support homecoming and prom. The class of
          2027 is looking forward to hosting the most epic prom Booker has ever seen. They are hard at work researching
          venues, themes, and activities for prom. Additionally, the juniors are working on their initiative for the
          2025-2026 school year. Our theme is Beautify Booker, and we will focus on enriching our campus with color and
          artistic flair. We can't wait to see everyone back at Booker in the fall!</p>

      <h2>SOPHOMORE CLASS</h2>

      <div class="box gold-box">
        <p>Sophomore SGA is actively planning on signing up its team for the upcoming Nathan Benson Breast Cancer Walk
          in October, aiming to raise awareness and support for those affected. Alongside this, they have several
          fundraisers in the works to support their initiatives and give back to the community! They're also looking to
          expand the Booker Basics Initiative, which provides girls with free feminine products in school bathrooms,
          promoting dignity and accessibility. Committed to fostering a positive and respectful school environment,
          Sophomore SGA is also exploring the creation of a mental health website where students can openly share their
          feelings about school and life, supporting emotional growth and peer connection.</p>
